The dataset includes 459 images.
Motorbike are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)
* Auto-contrast via histogram equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 30 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -12 and +12 degrees
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
